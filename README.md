# InstaLiq Contracts

This repo is for the development, testing, and deployment of InstaLiq smart contracts. Currently, this repository will support Solidity contracts on Ethereum.

The project is bootstrapped with Hardhat, leaving the boostrap files and instructions for 'Advanced Sample Hardhat Project' below for now until project-specific contracts/workflows/instructions are in place.
